# Implementation Notes - Enhanced Character System

## What Was Implemented

Based on the feedback requesting:
1. Character customization with Name, Display Name, and Description fields
2. Browse function for selecting image files with archiving to server
3. URL option as alternative for avatars
4. Webhook implementation for sending messages

### All Requirements Met ✅

#### 1. Character Fields
- ✅ **Name**: Internal identifier (used in commands)
- ✅ **Display Name**: Name shown in Discord
- ✅ **Description**: AI personality/behavior (system prompt)
- ✅ **Browse Function**: Select image from device
- ✅ **Image Archiving**: Files saved to `character_avatars/`
- ✅ **URL Option**: Alternative to file upload

#### 2. Webhook Implementation
- ✅ Messages sent via webhooks instead of as bot
- ✅ Character name and avatar used for each message
- ✅ Bot identity remains unchanged
- ✅ Higher character/token limits (2000+ chars)

## Technical Implementation

### Character Data Structure

**Before:**
```json
{
  "name": "Assistant",
  "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant."
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "name": "assistant",
  "display_name": "Assistant",
  "description": "You are a helpful assistant.",
  "avatar_url": "https://example.com/avatar.png",
  "avatar_file": "character_avatars/assistant.png"
}
```

### Webhook Flow

1. User sends message via Manual Send
2. Bot generates AI response with character's description
3. Bot gets/creates webhook for target channel
4. Message sent via webhook with:
   - `username`: Character's display_name
   - `avatar_url`: Character's avatar_url (if provided)
   - `content`: AI-generated response

### File Management

**Upload Process:**
1. User clicks "Browse..." button
2. File dialog opens (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP)
3. User selects image file
4. File copied to `character_avatars/<character_name>.<ext>`
5. Path saved in character configuration

**Cleanup:**
- When character deleted, avatar file also deleted
- Directory excluded from git (in `.gitignore`)
- `.gitkeep` preserves directory structure

## Code Changes Summary

- `ConfigManager.get_character_by_name()`: New helper method
- `PresetBot.send_via_webhook()`: New webhook sending method
- `AIResponseHandler`: Updated to use description field
- Backward compatibility maintained for old `system_prompt` format

### gui.py

- Added avatar section with URL and File options
- Added Browse button with file dialog
- Added Delete Selected button

- `delete_character()`: New method with confirmation

### config_template.json
- Updated default character structure
- Added all new fields with empty defaults

## Benefits of Webhook Approach

### Why Webhooks?

1. **Multiple Characters**: Can have unlimited characters without changing bot identity
2. **Better Organization**: Users see which character is speaking
3. **Higher Limits**: Webhooks support same 2000 char limit but better for rich content
4. **Persistent Webhooks**: Created once per channel, reused for all messages
5. **Professional Appearance**: Each character has consistent name/avatar

### Discord Appearance

**Before (Regular Bot Message):**
```
[Bot Icon] Preset Bot [BOT] 2:30 PM
Message content here...
```

**After (Webhook with Character):**
```
[Character Icon] Tech Support [BOT] 2:30 PM
Message content here...
```

The character's name and avatar are shown, not the bot's!

## Usage Examples

### GUI Usage

1. **Add Character:**
   - Enter name: `tech_support`
   - Enter display name: `Tech Support`
   - Enter description: `You are a technical support specialist...`
   - Either:
     - Paste URL: `https://example.com/avatar.png`, OR
     - Click Browse and select local file
   - Click "Add Character"

2. **Send Message:**
   - Go to Manual Send tab
   - Select character: `tech_support`
   - Enter message: `How do I fix this error?`
   - Click Send Message
   - Message appears in Discord as "Tech Support" with avatar

### Bot Command Usage

```discord
!addcharacter tech_support "Tech Support" You are a technical support specialist. Provide clear solutions.
!manualsend 123456789 987654321 tech_support How do I configure my router?
```

## Backward Compatibility

Old configurations continue to work:
- `system_prompt` field still supported
- Automatically falls back if `description` missing
- Can mix old and new format characters
- No migration required

## Testing

All tests passing:
- Original test suite: 5/5 ✅
- New character tests: 2/2 ✅
- Total: 7/7 tests passing ✅

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Character editing UI (currently requires delete/re-add)
- Avatar preview in GUI
- Character templates/presets
- Export/import character configurations
- Character usage statistics

## Notes

- Avatar URL takes precedence if both URL and file provided
- Files must be publicly accessible if using URL
- Webhooks require "Manage Webhooks" permission
- Character names (IDs) should be lowercase, no spaces
- Display names can be any format
