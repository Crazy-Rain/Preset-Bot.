# Implementation Summary: Intelligent Message Splitting & Config Reload

## Overview

This update addresses three key issues from the problem statement:

1. **Intelligent Message Splitting** - Messages no longer break mid-sentence
2. **Avatar Image Ordering** - Avatar images now send first, before text chunks
3. **Stale Configuration** - Bot commands now read fresh config data

## 1. Intelligent Message Splitting

### Problem
The previous implementation split messages at a fixed 1900-character boundary, often breaking sentences mid-way and creating a poor reading experience.

### Solution
Implemented `split_text_intelligently()` function that prioritizes natural break points:

1. **Sentence boundaries** (highest priority): `. ! ?` followed by space/newline
2. **Paragraph breaks**: Double newlines `\n\n`
3. **Word boundaries**: Spaces to avoid breaking words
4. **Hard split**: Only as last resort

### Code Changes
- **bot.py**: Added `split_text_intelligently()` function (lines 557-618)
- **bot.py**: Updated `send_via_webhook()` to use intelligent splitting (line ~1367)
- **gui.py**: Imported and uses `split_text_intelligently()` (line 14, ~850)

### Testing
Created `test_message_splitting.py` with 8 comprehensive tests:
- ✅ Short messages (no split needed)
- ✅ Sentence boundary splitting
- ✅ Paragraph boundary splitting
- ✅ Very long sentences (no boundaries)
- ✅ Word boundary splitting
- ✅ Mixed content (realistic scenarios)
- ✅ Edge cases (exact boundary, just over boundary)

All tests pass successfully.

## 2. Avatar Image Ordering Fix

### Problem
When splitting long messages with avatar images, the image was sent with the first text chunk. The requirement was to send the image FIRST on its own, THEN send the text chunks.

### Solution
Modified the webhook sending logic to:
1. If avatar image exists and message needs splitting:
   - Send avatar image first with empty text content
   - Then send all text chunks separately
2. Avatar URL is used for all messages to maintain consistent icon

### Code Changes
- **bot.py**: `send_via_webhook()` - sends avatar first when splitting (lines 1367-1392)
- **gui.py**: `send_via_webhook()` - same logic applied (lines 850-875)

### Behavior
**Before:**
```
Message 1: [Image + Text chunk 1]
Message 2: [Text chunk 2]
```

**After:**
```
Message 1: [Image only]
Message 2: [Text chunk 1]
Message 3: [Text chunk 2]
```

## 3. Stale Configuration Fix

### Problem
When the GUI saves changes to characters, avatars, lorebooks, etc., the bot.py process doesn't see these changes because it cached the config on startup. Users had to:
1. Stop bot.py
2. Save changes in GUI (which gets overwritten when bot stops)
3. Save changes again
4. Restart bot.py

### Solution
Added `reload_config()` method to ConfigManager that re-reads the config file from disk. Commands that access character/lorebook data now reload the config before executing.

### Code Changes
- **bot.py**: Added `reload_config()` method to ConfigManager (lines 94-96)
- **bot.py**: `!chat` command calls `reload_config()` before accessing data (line 914)
- **bot.py**: `!ask` command calls `reload_config()` before accessing data (line 895)
- **bot.py**: `!manualsend` command calls `reload_config()` before accessing data (line 867)
- **gui.py**: `send_manual_message()` calls `reload_config()` before sending (line 726)

### Testing
Created `test_config_reload.py` that verifies:
- ✅ External config changes are invisible before reload
- ✅ External config changes are visible after reload
- ✅ Character changes are picked up
- ✅ Lorebook changes are picked up

All tests pass successfully.

### User Impact
Users can now:
1. Make changes in the GUI
2. Save them
3. Immediately use bot commands (!chat, !ask, etc.) with the new data
4. **No bot restart required!**

## Documentation Updates

Updated `MESSAGE_SPLITTING.md` to document:
- New intelligent splitting algorithm
- Avatar-first ordering for split messages
- Config reload feature
- Updated examples showing new behavior

## Files Changed

1. **bot.py** (3 main changes):
   - Added `split_text_intelligently()` function
   - Updated `send_via_webhook()` with intelligent splitting and avatar-first ordering
   - Added `reload_config()` and calls to it in commands

2. **gui.py** (2 main changes):
   - Imported and uses `split_text_intelligently()`
   - Updated `send_via_webhook()` with intelligent splitting and avatar-first ordering
   - Added `reload_config()` call in `send_manual_message()`

3. **MESSAGE_SPLITTING.md**:
   - Documented new intelligent splitting behavior
   - Documented config reload feature
   - Updated examples

4. **test_message_splitting.py** (new):
   - Comprehensive tests for splitting function

5. **test_config_reload.py** (new):
   - Tests for config reload functionality

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing configs work without modification
- Short messages (< 2000 chars) behave identically
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Summary

All three issues from the problem statement have been resolved:

✅ **Intelligent sentence-aware splitting** - No more broken sentences  
✅ **Avatar image sent first** - Proper ordering when splitting messages  
✅ **Fresh config data** - No more stale data in bot commands  

The implementation is well-tested, documented, and maintains backward compatibility.
