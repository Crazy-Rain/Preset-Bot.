# Avatar Preview and User Character Chat Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Avatar Preview Feature

Added an image preview panel to both Characters and User Characters tabs in the GUI.

#### What it does:
- Shows a preview of the avatar image (from URL or file) before saving the character
- Displays the image at 128x128 pixels (Discord avatar size)
- Located to the right of the character form
- Click "Load Preview" button to load/refresh the preview

#### How to use:
1. Enter an Avatar URL or select an Avatar File
2. Click the "Load Preview" button
3. The avatar will be displayed in the preview panel
4. You can see exactly what the avatar will look like in Discord

#### Technical details:
- Added PIL/Pillow dependency for image processing
- Images are resized to 128x128 using LANCZOS resampling for quality
- Supports both URL-based and file-based avatars
- Preview is loaded on-demand (not automatic) to avoid unnecessary network requests

### 2. User Character Description in Chat Fix

Fixed the !chat command to properly include user character descriptions in the AI system prompt.

#### The Problem:
Previously, when using `!chat CharacterName message`, the user character's description was only appended to the current message. This meant:
- The AI only saw it once
- It forgot the character description in subsequent messages
- The character description didn't persist across the conversation

#### The Solution:
- Added `user_character_info` parameter to `get_ai_response()` function
- User character description is now added to the **system prompt**
- The AI remembers the character description throughout the entire conversation
- The description is part of the AI's context, not just a one-time message

#### How it works:
1. When user uses `!chat Alice Hello!`
2. System finds user character "Alice"
3. Extracts Alice's description
4. Adds it to the AI system prompt: "User is playing as Alice. Character description: [Alice's description]"
5. AI now knows about Alice's character throughout the conversation

#### Example:
```
User: !chat Alice Hello! How are you?
System prompt: "You are a helpful assistant.

User is playing as Alice.
Character description: Alice is a brave warrior from the northern kingdoms."

AI: (responds knowing that the user is playing as Alice, a brave warrior)
```

### Files Modified

1. **gui.py**
   - Added PIL/Pillow imports
   - Added avatar preview panel to Characters tab (column 3)
   - Added avatar preview panel to User Characters tab (column 3)
   - Added `load_char_avatar_preview()` method
   - Added `load_user_char_avatar_preview()` method
   - Added `char_avatar_preview_label` and `char_avatar_preview_image` attributes
   - Added `user_char_avatar_preview_label` and `user_char_avatar_preview_image` attributes

2. **bot.py**
   - Modified `get_ai_response()` to accept `user_character_info` parameter
   - Modified system prompt building to append user character info
   - Modified `chat` command to pass user character info to `get_ai_response()`
   - Removed the old method of appending user char info to the message

3. **requirements.txt**
   - Added Pillow>=10.0.0 for image processing

### Testing

Created `test_user_char_chat.py` to verify that user character info is properly added to the system prompt.

Test output:
```
Testing user character info in system prompt...
System prompt: You are a helpful assistant.

User is playing as Alice.
Character description: Alice is a brave warrior.
✓ Test passed! User character info was added to system prompt
✓ All tests passed!
```

### Benefits

**Avatar Preview:**
- See exactly what your avatar will look like before saving
- Catch issues with image size, format, or appearance early
- No need to save character and test in Discord to see avatar
- Faster workflow for character creation

**User Character Chat Fix:**
- AI now properly remembers user character descriptions
- More consistent roleplay experience
- Character descriptions persist throughout conversation
- Better AI understanding of the user's character

### Usage Examples

#### Avatar Preview
```
1. Open GUI
2. Go to Characters or User Characters tab
3. Enter avatar URL (e.g., https://example.com/avatar.png)
4. Click "Load Preview" button
5. See the avatar displayed in the preview panel
6. If it looks good, save the character
```

#### User Character Chat (Fixed)
```
Before (broken):
!chat Alice Hello!
→ AI sees Alice's description once, then forgets

After (fixed):
!chat Alice Hello!
→ AI remembers Alice's description for entire conversation
→ Subsequent messages maintain character context
```

### Notes

- Avatar preview requires Pillow library (automatically installed from requirements.txt)
- Preview images are cached to prevent garbage collection
- Preview loading may take a few seconds for URLs (network request)
- User character info is now part of system prompt, not user message
- Old chat history without user char info will continue to work normally
