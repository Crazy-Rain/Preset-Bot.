# Implementation Summary: View User/Character Commands

## Overview

This implementation adds three new commands to the Preset Bot that enhance the user experience when working with characters in the chat system:

1. **!viewu** - View your current user character
2. **!viewc** - View the current AI/Bot character for the channel
3. **!cimage** - Update user character avatars (equivalent to !image for user characters)

## Changes Made

### 1. New Bot Commands (bot.py)

#### !cimage Command
- **Lines**: ~1130-1207
- **Purpose**: Updates user character avatar images
- **Functionality**:
  - Accepts URL or Discord attachment
  - Downloads and saves image to `ucharacter_avatars/` directory
  - Updates user character config with both `avatar_url` and `avatar_file`
  - Supports PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP formats

#### !viewu Command
- **Lines**: ~1208-1277
- **Purpose**: Shows information about the user's current user character
- **Functionality**:
  - Without arguments: Finds the user's last used character by checking chat history
  - With character name: Shows information about that specific user character
  - Displays character name, ID, and avatar in a Discord embed
  - Includes interactive button to show full description
  - User-specific: Each Discord user has their own active character

#### !viewc Command
- **Lines**: ~1278-1347
- **Purpose**: Shows information about the channel's AI character
- **Functionality**:
  - Without arguments: Shows the channel's active AI character
  - With character name: Shows information about that specific AI character
  - Displays character name, ID, scenario preview, and avatar
  - Includes interactive button to show full description
  - Falls back to default character if none is set for the channel

### 2. Discord UI Integration

Both !viewu and !viewc use Discord's UI components:
- **discord.ui.View** for creating interactive button containers
- **discord.ui.Button** with label "Show Description"
- Ephemeral responses (only visible to the user who clicked)
- 5-minute timeout for button interactions

### 3. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- **NEW_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md** - Full guide with examples, use cases, and troubleshooting
- **COMMANDS_QUICK_REF.md** - Quick reference for common usage patterns
- Updated **README.md** to include new commands in the command list

### 4. Tests

Added thorough test coverage:
- **test_new_commands.py** - Unit tests for ConfigManager operations
- **test_integration_commands.py** - Integration tests simulating multi-user scenarios
- **demo_new_commands.py** - Interactive demo showing all features

## Key Features

### User Character Tracking
- Characters are tracked per Discord User ID
- Each user can have a different active character in the same channel
- History lookup uses the configured `chat_history_limit`
- Characters persist across bot restarts (stored in config.json)

### Interactive Embeds
- Rich Discord embeds with thumbnails (avatars)
- Color-coded: Green for user characters, Blue for AI characters
- Interactive buttons for viewing full descriptions
- Ephemeral button responses for privacy

### Avatar Management
- Dual storage: URL and local file path
- Automatic image download from URLs or Discord attachments
- Supports multiple image formats
- Images stored in `ucharacter_avatars/` directory

## Technical Details

### User Character Lookup Logic
```python
# Find user's active character from chat history
for msg in reversed(chat_history[-history_limit:]):
    if msg.get("user_character") and msg.get("author") == str(ctx.author.id):
        active_user_character = msg.get("user_character")
        break
```

### Channel Character Lookup Logic
```python
# Get channel's AI character
ai_character_name = config_manager.get_channel_character(channel_id)
if not ai_character_name:
    # Use default (first character)
    characters = config_manager.get_characters()
    char = characters[0] if characters else None
```

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ test_bot.py: 5/5 tests passed
- ✅ test_new_commands.py: 2/2 tests passed
- ✅ test_integration_commands.py: All scenarios passed
- ✅ demo_new_commands.py: Completed successfully

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Fully backward compatible:
- Existing commands unchanged
- Existing config files work without modification
- New commands are additions, not replacements
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```
!viewu                    # View your current user character
!viewc                    # View channel's AI character
!cimage alice url.png     # Update alice's avatar
```

### Advanced Usage
```
!viewu thorin            # View specific user character
!viewc narrator          # View specific AI character
```

### Workflow
```
1. Create user character in GUI
2. !cimage alice https://example.com/alice.png
3. !chat alice: "Hello!"
4. !viewu                # Confirms you're using alice
5. !viewc                # Confirms channel's AI character
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified
- `bot.py` - Added three new commands (~217 lines)
- `README.md` - Updated command list and documentation references

### Created
- `test_new_commands.py` - Unit tests
- `test_integration_commands.py` - Integration tests
- `demo_new_commands.py` - Interactive demonstration
- `NEW_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `COMMANDS_QUICK_REF.md` - Quick reference guide

## Known Limitations

1. **Button Timeout**: Interactive buttons expire after 5 minutes
   - Solution: Run the command again to get a fresh button

2. **No Character History**: !viewu only shows current character, not history
   - Intentional design: Keeps the interface simple

3. **Ephemeral Responses**: Button responses are private
   - Intentional design: Prevents chat spam

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
- Add character switching without sending a chat message
- Character usage statistics
- Character favorite/quick-select
- Multi-character management for power users

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully adds three new commands that enhance the user experience for character-based roleplaying in the Preset Bot. The commands are intuitive, well-documented, and thoroughly tested, with interactive Discord UI elements that make them easy to use.
