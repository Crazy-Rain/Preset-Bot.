# Chat Improvements Documentation

## Overview

This document covers the improvements made to the chat system based on user feedback.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Character Information Not Sent to AI

**Problem:**
When using `!chat sundial: <message>`, the user character's name and description were not being sent to the AI, so the AI didn't know about the character's persona.

**Solution:**
User character information is now automatically appended to the message when a user character is specified. The AI receives:
- User character display name
- User character description (if available)

**Example:**
```
!chat sundial: Describe Sundial to me.
```

The AI now receives:
```
Describe Sundial to me.

User is playing as Sundial.
Character description: A wise and ancient pony who guards the flow of time.
```

This ensures the AI has the full context about who the user is role-playing as.

## New Features

### !character Command

Sets which character the bot responds as in a specific channel. Each channel can have its own character independently.

**Syntax:**
```
!character <character_name>  # Set channel character
!character                   # Clear channel character (use default)
```

**Examples:**

Set channel character:
```
!character dashie
✓ Channel character set to 'Rainbow Dash'. All responses in this channel will use this character.
```

Clear channel character:
```
!character
Channel character cleared. Bot will use default character.
```

**Features:**
- Each Discord channel tracks its own active character
- Character persists across bot restarts (stored in config)
- Overrides the default "first character" behavior
- Works with all chat commands

**How It Works:**
1. When you use `!character dashie` in a channel, that channel is associated with the "dashie" character
2. All subsequent `!chat` commands in that channel will use "dashie" as the AI character
3. Other channels are unaffected and can have their own characters
4. The association is saved in `config.json` under `channel_characters`

**Use Cases:**
- Set #roleplay-channel to use your RP character
- Set #general to use a helpful assistant character
- Set #creative-writing to use a storyteller character
- Each channel maintains its own character independently

## Configuration Changes

### New Config Key: `channel_characters`

```json
{
  "channel_characters": {
    "123456789012345678": "dashie",
    "987654321098765432": "twilight"
  }
}
```

This maps Discord channel IDs to character names.

## API Changes

### ConfigManager New Methods

```python
# Get the active character for a channel
character_name = config_manager.get_channel_character(channel_id)

# Set the active character for a channel
config_manager.set_channel_character(channel_id, character_name)

# Clear the active character for a channel
config_manager.clear_channel_character(channel_id)
```

### !chat Command Enhancement

The `!chat` command now properly includes user character information when making AI requests.

**Before:**
```python
response = await self.ai_handler.get_ai_response(
    message,
    character_name=ai_character,
    additional_context=context_messages
)
```

**After:**
```python
# Add user character info to the message if present
full_message = message
if user_char_info:
    full_message = message + user_char_info

response = await self.ai_handler.get_ai_response(
    full_message,
    character_name=ai_character,
    additional_context=context_messages
)
```

## Testing

New test suite added: `test_chat_improvements.py`

Tests cover:
- ✅ User character creation and retrieval
- ✅ Channel character tracking (set/get/clear)
- ✅ Multiple channels with different characters
- ✅ Config structure includes channel_characters

All tests passing (3/3).

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Fully backward compatible
- Existing configs work without `channel_characters` key
- Old behavior preserved when no channel character is set
- Default character selection unchanged

## Future Enhancements

The following features were discussed but not yet implemented:
- **Lorebook System**: Active/inactive lorebooks with constant/normal entries (to be added in future PR)

## Examples

### Scenario 1: Role-Playing in Multiple Channels

**Channel #adventure:**
```
!character dashie
✓ Channel character set to 'Rainbow Dash'

!chat twilight: Let's go on an adventure!
[Rainbow Dash responds with her personality]
```

**Channel #study-session:**
```
!character twilight
✓ Channel character set to 'Twilight Sparkle'

!chat spike: What spell should I learn?
[Twilight Sparkle responds with her personality]
```

Each channel maintains its own character independently.

### Scenario 2: User Character Persona

```
# In GUI, create user character "Sundial" with description
# "A wise and ancient pony who guards the flow of time"

!character dashie
!chat sundial: Tell me about time magic.
```

The AI (as Dashie) now receives:
- The message: "Tell me about time magic"
- User persona: "User is playing as Sundial. Character description: A wise and ancient pony who guards the flow of time."

This gives the AI full context for appropriate responses.
