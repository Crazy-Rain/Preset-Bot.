# ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Complete: View User & Character Commands

## ðŸ“‹ Summary

Successfully implemented three new Discord bot commands for the Preset Bot that enhance the character management and roleplaying experience:

1. **!viewu** - View your current user character
2. **!viewc** - View the channel's AI character  
3. **!cimage** - Update user character avatars

## âœ… Requirements Fulfilled

âœ… **!viewc <Character Name>**
- Implemented to show which Bot/AI character is currently set for the channel
