# Quick Reference: Lorebook Fix

## What Was Fixed
Lorebooks that were deactivated in the GUI are now correctly excluded from AI responses without requiring a bot restart.

## What Changed
Two strategic `reload_config()` calls were added to `bot.py`:
1. In `get_ai_response()` - ensures AI responses use current lorebook states
2. In `!lorebook` command - ensures command output shows current states

## How to Verify

### Test 1: Deactivation Works
1. Create/activate a lorebook with a constant entry
2. Send a Discord message - entry should appear in response
3. Deactivate the lorebook in GUI (save changes)
4. Send another Discord message - entry should NOT appear
5. **No bot restart needed!**

### Test 2: Reactivation Works
1. Deactivate a lorebook in GUI
2. Verify it's not used in responses
3. Reactivate the lorebook in GUI (save changes)
4. Send a Discord message - entries should appear again
5. **Still no bot restart needed!**

### Test 3: Command Shows Current State
1. Run `!lorebook list` - see current states
2. Change lorebook states in GUI (save changes)
3. Run `!lorebook list` again - states should be updated
4. **No restart needed!**

## Files Modified

## Run Tests

python test_lorebook_dynamic_reload.py

# Run demonstration
python demo_lorebook_fix.py
```

## Key Benefits
✅ Real-time lorebook activation/deactivation  
✅ No bot restarts required  
✅ GUI changes take effect immediately  
✅ Commands show current state  
✅ Minimal code changes (6 lines)  
✅ All existing functionality preserved  

## Additional Benefits
This fix also provides dynamic reloading for:
- Character updates
- Preset changes
- Any other configuration modifications

## Performance Impact
Negligible - config file read happens once per AI request, which is already slow due to API latency.

## Compatibility
✅ Backward compatible  
✅ No breaking changes  
✅ All existing tests pass  
✅ Works with existing lorebook system
