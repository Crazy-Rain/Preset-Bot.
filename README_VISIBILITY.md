# Lorebook Visibility Improvements - README

## What This PR Does

This PR makes it **crystal clear** when lorebooks are active or inactive, addressing the issue: 
> "Activate/Deactivate doesn't seem to actually do anything for the Lorebooks?"

The functionality was already working - now it's **visible**!

## Quick Demo

Run this to see the improvements:
```bash
python demo_visibility_improvements.py
```

## What Changed?

### 1. Console Logging (Code-Side Visibility)
```
[Lorebook] Processing 'fantasy_world' - ACTIVE
[Lorebook] Added 2 entries from 'fantasy_world'
[Lorebook] Skipping 'scifi_world' - INACTIVE
```

### 2. GUI Enhancements (Visual Visibility)
- **Color coding:** Active = GREEN, Inactive = GRAY
- **Explicit labels:** "ACTIVE" / "INACTIVE" 
- **Status indicator:** Colored box showing current state
